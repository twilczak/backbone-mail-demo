This is my Backbone Demo. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Simple Mail Client Demonstrating several backbone features.

### v0.1.0 Baseline mail client:

   - Index.js: Root js file - initializes application.  
      (Any global js initialization or config can be performed here.)

   - MessageListView.js: Renders a preview list for sent messages.
   - MessageListItemView.js: Renders a preview for an individual message.
