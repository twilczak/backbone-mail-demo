==================
This is my Backbone Demo. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Simple Mail Client Demonstrating several backbone features.

### v0.1.0 Baseline mail client:

   - *Index.js*: Root js file - initializes application.  
      (Any global js initialization or config can be performed here.)  
   - *AppView.js*: Base application view - coordinates components needed for the our mail client.    
   - *MessageListView.js*: Renders a preview list for sent messages.
   - *MessageListItemView.js*: Renders a preview for an individual message.
   - *Message.js*: Model object which contains message data.
