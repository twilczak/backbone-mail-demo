==================
This is my Backbone Demo. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Simple Mail Client Demonstrating several backbone features.

### v0.1.0 Baseline mail client:

   1. Index.js: Root js file - initializes application.  
      (Any global js initialization or config can be performed here.)  
   2. AppView.js: Base application view - coordinates components needed for the our mail client.    
   3. MessageListView.js: Renders a preview list for sent messages.
   4. MessageListItemView.js: Renders a preview for an individual message.
   5. Message.js: Model object which contains message data.
